# WindmillRepair

A 2 player cooperative environmental puzzle game developed in Godot Engine 4.x. by 2 developers: Maiko & Ngaa

## Game Summary

The world is on the brink of losing its vibrant colors, swallowed by a creeping gray void. Nature is fading, cities are sinking into chaos, and sustainable energy sources are failing.

Two unlikely heroes, a wise Owl and a curious Rabbit, witness the crisis firsthand when a massive flood strikes the Netherlands. As they struggle against the rising waters, a sudden force plunges them into darkness.

They awaken inside the mechanisms of a massive wind turbine, surrounded by broken gears and unresponsive controls. With no other choice, they must solve the puzzle to restore power. This is only the beginning of their journey. Guided by a mysterious voice over a broken transmitter, they embark on a quest across Europe to restore balance by solving environmental puzzles, spreading awareness, and fighting against the growing darkness that threatens to consume everything.

Their mission is clear: reignite sustainable solutions and bring back the world's natural beauty before it is too late.
